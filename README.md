# muca-tools
Mullticast tools for the linux command line

Just started with this project. At home I'm using UPnP for playing music in several rooms with Raspberry Pis and also multicast video streams from my IPTV provider. It works, but not complete as expected. I also need a command line control point to modify the volume of the Raspberry Pi renderer with scripting. I've looked around but could not find what I needed. So I decided to make it myself.
